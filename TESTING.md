# Testing

I have completed a series of manual and automated tests to:

- Ensure core functionalities like task creation, editing, and deletion work correctly.
- Validate user interactions with forms, views, and the overall user interface.
- Test the application's response to edge cases and invalid inputs.
- Maintain a high level of code quality and minimizing potential bugs.

## Automated Testing

I have completed a series of methods in my test_forms.py and test_views.py to validate both my form and views are working as expected. As shown in the screenshot below, the application ran into no issues with these tests:
