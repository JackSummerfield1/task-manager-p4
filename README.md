## Agile Methodology

The plan for this project was carried out using Agile Methodology. GitHub Issues, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/JackSummerfield1/task-manager-p4/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), were used to recored the User Stories.

Each User Story contains Acceptance Criteria which I sometimes had to change after I did the process as it didn't meet the criteria I initially aimed for.

[Here](https://github.com/users/JackSummerfield1/projects/3) is also a link to my KanBan board.

## User Experience (UX)

### Strategy / Site Goals

This Task Manager Website provides a secure and efficient platform for users to manage their tasks. The website allows logged-in users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their tasks. User authentication ensures data privacy, and the platform supports role-specific functionalities for users, administrators, and developers.
